# 2048, made using C and raylib
Hi there! This is a remake of the game [2048](https://play2048.co/) I made using C and [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib)
to practice actually finishing the projects that I start. That's about it. You can download the compiled game from the latest release.
Note that this is not a perfect 1-to-1 recreation of the original game. The font is [Clear Sans Bold](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/clear-sans)
and the sound effects were made by [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/). The rest, such as the code and the music, was made by me. I hope you enjoy ^^
